# WaveOS

Android custom ROM project based on AOSP, with a perfect blend of aesthetic, functionality and most importantly, performance.

## Getting started

To get started with WaveOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) and Version Control with [Git](https://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

To initialize the WaveOS sources locally, use a command like this:
```
 repo init -u https://github.com/whyredfire/wave-manifest -b r
```

Then to sync up:
```
 repo sync -c --force-sync --optimized-fetch --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --prune -j$(nproc --all)
```

## Finally, to build

```
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ brunch <device>
```
